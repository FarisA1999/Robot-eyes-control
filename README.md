# Robot-eyes-control
# Brief:
- Control two LEDs as the eyes of the robot.
# The work: 
In order to save energy:

-We used a photoresistor to control the leds.

-We used PWM technique by keep switching the state of the led in short time.

here is the [circuit diagram](https://github.com/FarisA1999/robot-eyes-control-/blob/main/eyes%20control%20circuit.png)
and here is the [Arduino code](https://github.com/FarisA1999/robot-eyes-control-/blob/main/eyes%20control%20code.ino) to operate it
